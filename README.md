# soundrop
A complete rewrite of one of my favorite iPad apps.

Essentially a musical game involving balls falling on lines which emit sounds. The original emitted
sounds of a pitch proportional to the speed of the falling ball, but this version intends to use the more
logical (IMHO) method of emitting a pitch proportional to the length of the line the ball hits.

An exploration in javascript, HTML5 Canvas, and using sound from the browser.

Update: Getting reliable cross-platform sound in the browser without using a massive framework may be difficult. Currently exploring options.
